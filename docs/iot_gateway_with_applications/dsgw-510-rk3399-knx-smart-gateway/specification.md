# **DSGK-510 KNX Smart Gateway**

## **1. Product Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose and Description**

DSGW-510 is a KNX data gateway that can be easily installed on rails. The product has Ethernet, KNX, WiFi, LTE functions, and is equipped with RS485, RS232, M-Bus, and CAN interfaces. Therefore, it can collect data and issue commands through various methods. This product can also be optionally equipped with BLE, ZigBee, and Z-wave modules, further increasing the types and quantities of sub devices that can be connected. The product reserves expansion interfaces, which can externally expand IO and wireless modules, and can achieve various wireless or local bus interface functions. The product can be widely used in various automation scenarios such as smart buildings and smart homes.<br />
